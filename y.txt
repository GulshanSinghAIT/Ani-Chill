2.	Connect PCs with one switch and switch to five servers with a copper straight through cable.
3.	Name all PCs and Servers suitably.

Configuring IP address for rest of network:
1.	Go to Webserver -> IP Configuration select DHCP.
2.	By doing so it will automatically fill the IP Address and DNS server address.
3.	Repeat the same process for DNS server, FTP server, Mail server, PC0, PC1 and PC2.

Configuring Mail server:
1.	Go to Mail Server -> Services -> Email.
2.	Turn on services and add user and password for PCO, PC1 and PC2.
3.	After this go to PCO and configure mail from desktop.

Configuring Web Server
1.	Go to Web server -> services -> HTTP.
2.	Edit the index.html file to get desired output on the web page.

Accessing Web server from PCO using DNS:
1.	Open Web browser on any PC let's say PC0.
2.	Then write you domain name.

Configure FTP Server using packet tracer. Set username and password on FTP server.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) over two networks:
1.	Firstly, to setup go to FTP server.
2.	Go to services -> FTP
3.	Enable FTP them configure it by adding PCs user and password along with enabling   permissions.

4.	Go to any PC say PC1, then to Desktop->text editor.
5.	Write something.
6.	Give suitable name with txt extension and save.

Adding a file to server.
1.	Go to The PC in first network (same network as that of server).
2.	Go to desktop->command Prompt.
3.	Type FTP and then IP address of the server
4.	Login using same username and password.
5.	Use command "put filename. Extension" to put the file onto the server.
6.	Now file will be present on the server.

Adding file from server to different network:
1.	Go to PC2.
2.	Go to Desktop -> command prompt.
3.	Login to server using ftp.
4.	Use command get FTP_test.txt, as FTP_test.txt is the file name.
5.	Now after successful transfer file from PC1 is present in PC2 via FTP server.
